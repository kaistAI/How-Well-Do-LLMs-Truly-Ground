This suggests that early ornithischians had relatively huge eyes that faced laterally. The forelimbs of early ornithischians are considerably shorter than their hindlimbs.", "L_DOC899": "A small forelimb such as those present in early ornithischians would not have been useful for locomotion, and it is evident that early ornithischians were bipedal dinosaurs.

Some argue that the opisthopubic pelvis evolved a fourth time, in the clade Dromaeosauridae, but this is controversial, as other authors argue that dromaeosaurids are mesopubic.

This time allows concrete to not only be cast in forms, but also to have a variety of tooled processes preformed. The hydration process is exothermic, which means ambient temperature plays a significant role in how long it takes concrete to set.", "L_DOC915": "Often, additives (such as pozzolans or superplasticizers) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix, delay or accelerate the curing time, or otherwise change the finished material. Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials (such as steel rebar) embedded to provide tensile strength, yielding reinforced concrete.

The lock mechanism held within a clamp a two to three feet long length of smoldering rope soaked in saltpeter, which was the match.

Steam carriages were much less likely to overturn, they travelled faster than horse-drawn carriages, they were much cheaper to run, and caused much less damage to the road surface due to their wide tyres.However, the heavy road tolls imposed by the turnpike trusts discouraged steam road vehicles and left the way clear for the horse bus companies, and from 1861 onwards, harsh legislation", "L_DOC1553": "An excursion is a trip by a group of people, usually made for leisure, education, or physical purposes.

Short stature can also be caused by the bone plates fusing at an earlier age than normal, therefore stunting growth.", "L_DOC2312": "Normally, the bone age is the same as the biological age but for some people, it is older. For many people with advanced bone ages, they hit a growth spurt early on which propels them to average height but stop growing at an earlier age.

Most of the victims were reportedly elderly men.The famine was alleviated first by \"Swedish bread\" flour shipped in from Sweden to Dutch harbours, and subsequently by the airlift of food by the Royal Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force, and the United States Army Air Forces \u2013 after an agreement with the occupying Germans that if the Germans did not shoot at the mercy flights, the Allies would not bomb the German positions.", "L_DOC2319": "These were Operations Manna and Chowhound.

Named MIThenge, the event  is celebrated by students, faculty, and staff. == Significance ==\nThe corridor is important not only because it links major MIT buildings, but also because it serves as the most direct indoor route between the east and west ends of the campus.", "L_DOC2607": "The corridor was designed as the central spine of the original set of MIT buildings designed by William W. Bosworth in 1913.The Infinite Corridor is slightly longer than that of the University Hall building at the University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, which measures 800 feet (240 m) long. It is, however, significantly shorter than the so called \"K-Stra\u00dfe\" (K-street) in the Rost-/Silberlaube building of the Free University of Berlin, which measures about 320 metres (1,050 ft). == Etiquette ==\nOn occasion, students in the Transport Lab of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) have studied foot traffic in the Infinite Corridor, as a safer, more accessible model of highway traffic.", "L_DOC2608": "In 1997, one student report made the following observations about the informal rules that seem to apply to Infinite Corridor traffic:\nThe rules of the road for the Infinite Corridor include: stay to the right, limit group size, pass on the left, form a line at bottlenecks, don't stop/slow down, no tailgating, traffic within corridor has right of way, no physical contact and no eye contact. == Hacks ==\nBecause the heavy pedestrian traffic in the Infinite Corridor guarantees a large audience, it is a setting for some \"hacks\" (practical jokes), especially those of a serial nature such as a series of \"Burma Shave\" style signs. The \"Mass Toolpike\" hack  in 1985 involved placing traffic signals, lane markings, and highway-like signs along the length of the Infinite Corridor.", "L_DOC2609": "An April Fools' Day post from the Alumni Association blog Slice of MIT suggested that the corridor floor would be replaced with a self-powering moving walkway made of piezoelectric tiles. == Geography ==\n=== Entrance ===\nAn outside grand stairway leads up from Massachusetts Avenue  to Lobby 7, the main entrance to the Infinite Corridor.

There, computer terminals located in different travel agencies were linked to a large IBM mainframe computer, which processed transactions simultaneously and coordinated them so that all travel agents had access to the same information at the same time. At some point between 1971 and 1972, students at Stanford and MIT used the internet precursor ARPANET to make a deal to exchange marijuana, but the interaction doesn't qualify as e-commerce because no money was transferred online.The emergence of online shopping as it is known today developed with the emergence of the Internet.", "L_DOC2619": "Initially, this platform only functioned as an advertising tool for companies, providing information about their products. It quickly moved on from this simple utility to actual online shopping transaction due to the development of interactive Web pages and secure transmissions.
